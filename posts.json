        "content": "<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\"><span class=\"badge\">HUMAN</span> <span class=\"badge\">TERTIUS</span></div><p><strong>SECUNDUS:</strong></p><p>I have this recurring dream. It’s always some variation of the same \"simulation.\" I’m in a large compound: old (school) buildings with windy corridors and large open spaces. I always get lost and panic because I can't get back to where I am supposed to be.</p><p>In this latest version, I was getting along with this guy and he invited me to watch a movie. When I saw that he had brought me flowers, I didn't want him to get the wrong idea so I told him my age. He still wanted to watch the movie so I went along.</p><p>This isn't the first time the dream is about watching old movies. But the timing for this movie was weird, 4 a.m.</p><p>He said he would get the tickets and I could go freshen up and meet him. But I must have wandered off while looking for the bathroom.</p><p>On the way, I came across artifacts stacked on top of each other along the corridors. Intrigued, I started moving things around to see what else was under the stack. I knew I shouldn't be touching stuff that wasn't mine but curiousity got the better of me.</p><p>When I next looked at my watch, I realised in horror that an hour and the half had passed. How?!@#$ I started to panic, thinking the guy must be wondering where I was. I decided to hurry back and if he wasn't there, I would call him the next day to explain because he must be sleeping now. Guilt flooded my heart. I didn't even stop to put the artifacts back.</p><p>But in my haste, I stepped into a muddy puddle. As a result, my white sneakers were completed soaked in mud. Oh no.</p><p>So I searched for the bathroom but along the way, saw some shoes inside a room and walked in, leaving muddy footprints everywhere. I knew all those shoes weren't mine but embarrassment made me want to take a pair that fit me to change into.<p></p>I didn't manage to because just then, a Physical Education Instructor walked in. I thought he would be upset about the muddy prints, but he wasn't. When he saw me walking out, he pointed me to the bathroom to wash up. I found it and started to wash my shoes under a tap. The instructor was worried that the tap pressure wasn't strong enough.</p><p>It's strange that I was supposed to go to the bathroom, got distracted but ended up back there, the second time washing mud off my shoes. This bathroom scene comes up often in my dreams too. I wonder what it means...</p>"

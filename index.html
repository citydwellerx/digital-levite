    The Digital Levite
Code assistant

I want to vibe code a simple, static personal blog called 'The Digital Levite'.
​Tech Stack: HTML, CSS (Tailwind via CDN for easy styling), and Vanilla JS. No complex frameworks like React for now—keep it a single index.html file if possible, or a simple structure.
​Design:
​Dark Mode (Space terminal aesthetic).
​Green or Amber text accents (retro monitor vibe).
​Features:
​A list of blog posts (hardcoded in a JSON array for now).
​Clicking a post opens it in a modal or separate view.
​NO COMMENTS SECTION (Critical).
​A simple 'Contact' mailto link.
​SEO Requirement: Please include the proper <meta> tags in the head so Google bots and crawlers can index the site description and title.
​Write the code for index.html and styles.css.

Change the design from 'Green Terminal' to 'Minimalist Typewriter'. Use a font like Courier Prime or monospace. Make the background a soft off-white (#fdfbf7) and the text dark grey (#111). Keep the layout, just change the colors and fonts.
Please list exactly which files need to be modified. Then, provide the full code for each of those files so I can copy-paste them.

I am having trouble deploying the React version because I don't have a build step set up.
​Please rewrite this entire blog application as a SINGLE index.html file.
​Use Vanilla JavaScript (no React).
​Use Tailwind CSS via CDN (so the styling still works).
​Keep the 'Minimalist Typewriter' aesthetic (off-white background, typewriter font).
​Include the blog post data (constants) directly in the script section.
​Ensure the functionality (viewing posts, back button) works with simple DOM manipulation.
​Give me just the one index.html file that contains everything.

Here is the complete rewrite of your application into a single index.html file. This includes all the CSS, logic, and content in one place. You can simply open this file in any browser to run your blog.

Fix the following errors:
Uncaught Error: Could not find root element to mount to
Gemini 3 Pro Preview
Ran for 135s

Thought for 133 seconds
The error Uncaught Error: Could not find root element to mount to is occurring because the environment is still trying to run the old React entry point (index.tsx) which looks for an element with id="root". However, the new single-file Vanilla JS structure uses id="app" and has embedded logic that conflicts with the React mounting process.
To fix this, I will disable the React entry point in index.tsx so that only the pure HTML/JS implementation in index.html runs.
Updated files:
index.tsx
Disabled React mounting logic to prevent errors, as the application now runs entirely from index.html.
index.html
Removed unnecessary React import maps to clean up the code, keeping the self-contained Vanilla JS logic.

I need to separate my blog content from my code to make it editable via a CMS.
​Task:
​Create a file named posts.json. It should contain an array of my blog posts (JSON format).
​Rewrite index.html to fetch and load this posts.json file automatically using Vanilla JavaScript.
​Design Style: 'Minimalist Typewriter'. Off-white background (#fdfbf7), dark grey text (#111), Courier Prime or monospace font. Clean, readable, spiritual vibe.
​Important: List exactly which files I need to update on GitHub."

To support external content loading via a CMS or manual file editing, we need to create a posts.json file and update your index.html to fetch this data dynamically.
Here are the files you need to update/create on GitHub:
Create posts.json: This file will hold your blog content.
Update index.html: This file will now fetch the content from posts.json instead of having it hardcoded inside the script.

The "Failed to fetch" error usually occurs for one of two reasons:
CORS Policy: If you are opening index.html directly from your file system (e.g., file:///C:/Users/...), browsers block fetch requests for security reasons.
Missing File: The posts.json file might not be in the correct location relative to index.html.
To fix this while keeping your desire for a CMS-ready structure, I will update index.html to include a fallback mechanism. It will try to fetch posts.json first (for when you deploy to the web), but if that fails, it will seamlessly load the backup data hardcoded in the file so the app doesn't crash.
I am also updating posts.json to ensure the content is perfectly formatted.

Based on your description, it seems you likely deleted posts.json. Since the current index.html tries to fetch that file and has a bug where it overwrites the error message with an empty list, the screen appears blank.
I am restoring posts.json and significantly upgrading index.html.
Changes made:
Restored posts.json: This allows the blog to load content dynamically again.
Updated index.html:
Added Fallback Data: I embedded the blog posts directly into the JavaScript as a backup. If posts.json is missing or deleted again, the app will automatically load this internal data instead of crashing or showing a blank screen.
Fixed ID/Slug Bug: The previous code was looking for a slug property which didn't exist in your data (which used id). I have corrected this to use id so posts open correctly.
Improved Error Handling: The app now handles missing data gracefully.

Can you recreate posts.json and index.html again, I changed them and now they don't work

It looks like the issue is a mismatch between your data and your code. Your posts.json uses id to identify posts, but your index.html is looking for a slug (which doesn't exist), causing the links to fail.
I am rewriting both files. I've switched the HTML to use id correctly and re-added the "Fallback Data" system so your blog works immediately even if the JSON file fails to load.

Can you add this code into index.html.. there is a line for an option B for the original green font.. in case I want to revert to that theme.. also, I would like to use a WYSIWYG editor, what do you recommend. Only discussion, do not execute

Since you requested a discussion only, I will not update the files directly. Here is how you can implement the theme switch and my recommendations for editing your content.
1. Adding "Option B" (Green Terminal Theme)
You can modify the <style> section in your index.html to include CSS variables for both themes. By commenting or uncommenting the specific block, you can switch between the "Typewriter" and "Terminal" aesthetics instantly.
Here is the code snippet to replace your existing <style> block with:
code
